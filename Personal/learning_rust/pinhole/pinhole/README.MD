### Exploring Rust through a project

## I'll be attempting to create a pinhole camera model for my thesis

This project will attempt to estimate the volume of a food object with proper reference object.

It will take in data for the segmentation and be manipulate in `image_process.rs` : 

The `pinhole.rs` will be where all the logic and algorithms be for the pinhole camera model
